## Writing a browser involves the integration of several key modules that work together to provide the ability to browse the web. 

The following are the main modules in the browser: 
1. user interface (UI): 
-provides an interface for users to interact with the browser, including address bar, forward / back buttons, bookmarks, history, etc. 
2. Network engine: 
-responsible for communicating with the network, including sending and receiving HTTP requests, processing SSL/TLS connections, and parsing URL. 
3. rendering engine (Renderer): 
-responsible for parsing and rendering web content, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This module usually uses its own JavaScript engine, such as WebKit's JavaScriptCore or Blink's V8. 
4. JavaScript engine: 
-executes the JavaScript code in the web page. 
This engine needs to execute JavaScript code efficiently and safely while providing good performance. 
5. Storage: 
-manage the local data storage of web pages, including Cookie, local storage, IndexedDB, etc. 
6. Security: 
-responsible for handling security-related functions, such as SSL/TLS connection, homology policy, content security policy, etc. 
7. plug-in system: 
-support browser extensions and plug-ins that allow users to add new features or modify existing ones. 
8. data processing: 
-processing and parsing web page data, such as XML, JSON, etc. 
9. Multimedia processing: 
-handle multimedia content in web pages, such as audio, video and pictures. 
10. performance Monitoring: 
-Monitoring and reporting the performance of web pages, including page loading time, JavaScript execution time, etc. 
11. Resource Management: 
-manage web resources, such as pictures, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. 
12. Cache: 
-caching web pages and resources to improve loading speed and performance. 
These modules need to work together to ensure that browsers can display web content efficiently and safely. 
Writing a browser requires an in-depth understanding of the functions of these modules and the interaction between them.
